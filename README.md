## Lyrics

```
HOOK

what's fair is not the aim
crushed by a world all gang (old gang)
all gang all in together
years apart, same place
aye

CHORUS

what's fair is not the aim
crushed by a world all gang 
all in together
years apart, same place
I know connection's hard enough
(in this state) distaste i don't wanna fight
i don't wanna lose my place yeah
i don't wanna lose my place

gotta race
what a place
and erase yeah
what a place?

gotta fight for this place
watch what i'm doing
while you have something to say
lose my face throwing tantrums 
masks on every step
it's really not the case
of falling into disrepair

VERSE



HOOK 



CHORUS

---

(one of) what's fair is not the aim
crushed by a world all gang all in together
years apart, same place
I know connection's hard (enough)

```
